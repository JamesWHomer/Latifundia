This is land claiming plugin and in the future will (maybe) be a state/clans management system as well. I'm making it for my IB Computer Science IA and there's a good chance it will see use in a Minecraft server. It uses a quadtree algorithm to aid in far faster checks than a traditional hashmap (I think).
